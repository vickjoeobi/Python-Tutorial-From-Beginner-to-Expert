    "## Definition of Python string\n",
    "\n",
    "A string is a collection of characters, while a charcter is regarded as a symbol that may or mayot have relative meaning. Example we have the Arabish character, English Character etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are alot of other technical jargons in between from the encondings  (unicode) and ASCII. \n",

    "Lets continue with how strings are initialized or created. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Initialization of String in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very simple to know if a varaibale is a string in python. All variables that appear within a quote either single quote `''` or double quote `\"\"` are assumed to be a string. \n",
    "\n",
    "A string cane declared by simply writing out the variable name and supplying the value of the variable. Lets see some example: "

    "1. The second example is a number `35` but it was still represented as a string. This means that both numbers and letters can be represented as a string. It all depends on the usecase. \n",
    "2. Can you observe that the last three example, have different indentation from the first three (i.e there is no space before the `=` or after it)? White space is not necessary while declaring a variable, we just add white space to make our code beautiful and readable. \n",

    "## Accessing a string\n",
    "Assuming i am writing a program to you were able to collect date of birth as a string. Example `10 05 1996` this translates to 10th of May 1996. You are now demanded to extract only the birth month to display since the user does not want his age displayed. \n",

    "Python offers us the capability to access each individual character in a string and do with it whatever we want, we can save it as another string, edit it, delete it or anything. Let's see how this can be acheived. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets start with a basic indexing. If we have a string example `love` that has four characters, therefore when you start counting it you will get four, however most programming languages starts counting or call it indexing from `0`. This means that the first character is counted as zero, the second one 1 etc. In the case of love it can be indexed as \n",

    "Python also offer the possibility of using slicing while dealing with strings. Slicing simply means you can decide to extract a partcular range of charcters using their index numbers. The important thing to note is that while slicing, the first part is inclusive while the last part is exclusive. By this i mean that the first number before the slice operator would be included in the count, while the number after will not be included. ``:`` is regarde as the slice operator. For example if we have ``2:4`` this usually should indicate from the Third character to the 5th character since our index is 0, but this is wrong. It means from the third character to the fourth character. \n",
